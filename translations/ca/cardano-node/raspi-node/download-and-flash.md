## Installing the RaspiNode OS

**1. Download the Armada Alliance's pre-configured Raspbian 64bit OS Cardano-node image** [**here**](https://db.adamantium.online/RasPi-Node.img.gz) **and save it in an accessible location for now on your computer.**

**2. Next, download the Raspberry Pi Imager software that we will use in order to write the OS image onto our target drive. This software is located on the** [**Raspberry Pi website**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/)**. Please download the correct version for your computer.**

**3. Insert the target drive\(your SSD or NVMe with usb3 adapter\) into your computer and open the "Raspberry Pi Imager".**

* **Click on "CHOOSE OS"  then "Use custom" choose the Raspbian image file you downloaded.**
* **Next, click on the "CHOOSE SD" and choose the target drive you inserted into the computers usb port.**
* **The "WRITE" button will appear and you can click on it to begin writing/verifying the OS onto the target drive.**
* **Finally, once it has finished the writing/verifying process, you will see a pop-up window saying that the OS was successfully written to the drive, click "CONTINUE" and remove your drive from the computer.**

## Boot & Configure

Insert the SSD into one of the blue usb3 ports. Then insert the HDMI, Keyboard, Mouse, Ethernet and power supply.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The first Pi4's to ship do not boot from USB3 by default, nowadays they do. If your image does not boot the two most common issues are older firmware on your Pi or an incompatible USB3 adaptor.

{% hint style="info" %}
All we really need to do here is disable auto login & create the ada user with sudo privileges. After we log back in we will delete the default Pi user and configure the server & environment for cardan-node & cardano-cli.
