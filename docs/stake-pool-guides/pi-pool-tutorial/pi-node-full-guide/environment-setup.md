description: Configure the environment for Cardano Node
---

# Environment Setup

## Choose testnet or mainnet.

{% hint style="danger" %}
There is a 500 ₳ Registration deposit and another 5 ₳ in registration costs to start a pool on mainnet. First time users are strongly reccomended to use testnet. You can get tada (test ada) from the testnet faucet. [tada faucet link](https://testnets.cardano.org/en/testnets/cardano/tools/faucet/)
{% endhint %}

Create the directories for our project.

```bash
mkdir -p ${HOME}/.local/bin
mkdir -p ${HOME}/pi-pool/files
mkdir -p ${HOME}/pi-pool/scripts
mkdir -p ${HOME}/pi-pool/logs
mkdir ${HOME}/git
mkdir ${HOME}/tmp
```

Create an .adaenv file, choose which network you want to be on and source the file. This file will hold the variables/settings for operating a Pi-Node. /home/ada/.adaenv

```shell
echo -e NODE_CONFIG=testnet >> ${HOME}/.adaenv; source ${HOME}/.adaenv
```

### Create bash variables & add \~/.local/bin to our $PATH 🏃

{% hint style="info" %}
[Environment Variables in Linux/Unix](https://askubuntu.com/questions/247738/why-is-etc-profile-not-invoked-for-non-login-shells/247769#247769).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must reload environment files after updating them. Same goes for cardano-node, changes to the topology or config files require a cardano-service restart.
{% endhint %}

```bash
echo . ~/.adaenv >> ${HOME}/.bashrc
cd .local/bin; echo "export PATH=\"$PWD:\$PATH\"" >> $HOME/.adaenv
echo export NODE_HOME=${HOME}/pi-pool >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export NODE_PORT=3003 >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export NODE_FILES=${HOME}/pi-pool/files >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export TOPOLOGY='${NODE_FILES}'/'${NODE_CONFIG}'-topology.json >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export DB_PATH='${NODE_HOME}'/db >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export CONFIG='${NODE_FILES}'/'${NODE_CONFIG}'-config.json >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export NODE_BUILD_NUM=$(curl https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/iohk-nix/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/index.html | grep -e "build" | sed 's/.*build\/\([0-9]*\)\/download.*/\1/g') >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
echo export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH="${HOME}/pi-pool/db/socket" >> ${HOME}/.adaenv
source ${HOME}/.bashrc; source ${HOME}/.adaenv
```

## Build Libsodium

This is IOHK's fork of Libsodium. It is needed for the dynamic build binary of cardano-node.

```bash
cd; cd git/
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/libsodium
cd libsodium
git checkout 66f017f1
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Echo library paths .bashrc file and source it.

```bash
echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"" >> ~/.bashrc
. ~/.bashrc
```

Update link cache for shared libraries and confirm.

```bash
sudo ldconfig; ldconfig -p | grep libsodium
```

## Build a static binary of jq

We need a static binary we can move to the offline machine later in the guide.

```bash
cd; cd git
git clone https://github.com/stedolan/jq.git
cd jq/
git submodule update --init
autoreconf -fi
./configure --with-oniguruma=builtin
make LDFLAGS=-all-static
make check
sudo make install
```

Confirm.

```bash
jq -V
# jq-1.6-145-ga9f97e9-dirty
which jq
# /usr/local/bin/jq
```

### Retrieve node files

```bash
cd $NODE_FILES
wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-config.json
wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-byron-genesis.json
wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-shelley-genesis.json
wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-alonzo-genesis.json
wget -N https://hydra.iohk.io/build/${NODE_BUILD_NUM}/download/1/${NODE_CONFIG}-topology.json
wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/master/cardano-submit-api/config/tx-submit-mainnet-config.yaml
```

Run the following to modify ${NODE\_CONFIG}-config.json and update TraceBlockFetchDecisions to "true" & listen on all interfaces with Prometheus Node Exporter.

```bash
sed -i ${NODE_CONFIG}-config.json \
    -e "s/TraceBlockFetchDecisions\": false/TraceBlockFetchDecisions\": true/g" \
    -e "s/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/g"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip for relay nodes**: It's possible to reduce memory and cpu usage by setting "TraceMemPool" to "false" in **{NODE\_CONFIG}-config.json.** This will turn off mempool data in Grafana and gLiveView.sh.
{% endhint %}

### Retrieve aarch64 1.33.1 and cardano-submit-api binaries

{% hint style="info" %}
The **unofficial** cardano-node, cardano-cli and cardano-submit-api binaries available to us are being built by an IOHK engineer in his **spare time**. Consider delegating to zw3rk pool to support mobile Haskel development.
{% endhint %}

```bash
cd ${HOME}/tmp
wget https://ci.zw3rk.com/build/434354/download/1/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl-cardano-node-73f9a746362695dc2cb63ba757fbcabb81733d23.zip
unzip *.zip
mv cardano-node/cardano-* ${HOME}/.local/bin
rm -r cardano*
cd ${HOME}
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If binaries already exist (if updating) you will have to confirm overwriting the old ones.
{% endhint %}

Confirm binaries are in $USER's $PATH.

```bash
cardano-node version
cardano-cli version
```

### Systemd unit startup scripts

Create the systemd unit file and startup script so systemd can manage cardano-node.

```bash
nano ${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-service
```

Paste the following, save & exit.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
. /home/ada/.adaenv

## +RTS -N4 -RTS = Multicore(4)
cardano-node run +RTS -N4 -RTS \
  --topology ${TOPOLOGY} \
  --database-path ${DB_PATH} \
  --socket-path ${CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH} \
  --port ${NODE_PORT} \
  --config ${CONFIG}
```

Allow execution of our new cardano-node service file.

```bash
chmod +x ${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-service
```

Open /etc/systemd/system/cardano-node.service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cardano-node.service
```

Paste the following, You will need to edit the username here if you chose to not use ada. Save & exit.

```bash
# The Cardano Node Service (part of systemd)
# file: /etc/systemd/system/cardano-node.service

[Unit]
Description     = Cardano node service
Wants           = network-online.target
After           = network-online.target

[Service]
User            = ada
Type            = simple
WorkingDirectory= /home/ada/pi-pool
ExecStart       = /bin/bash -c "PATH=/home/ada/.local/bin:$PATH exec /home/ada/.local/bin/cardano-service"

TimeoutStopSec=10
LimitNOFILE=32768
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
EnvironmentFile=-/home/ada/.adaenv

[Install]
WantedBy= multi-user.target
```

Create the systemd unit file and startup script so systemd can manage cardano-submit-api.

```bash
nano ${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-submit-service
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
. /home/ada/.adaenv

cardano-submit-api \
  --socket-path ${CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH} \
  --port 8090 \
  --config /home/ada/pi-pool/files/tx-submit-mainnet-config.yaml \
  --listen-address 0.0.0.0 \
  --mainnet
```

Allow execution of our new cardano-submit-api service script.

```bash
chmod +x ${HOME}/.local/bin/cardano-submit-service
```

Create /etc/systemd/system/cardano-submit.service.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/cardano-submit.service
```

Paste the following, You will need to edit the username here if you chose to not use ada. save & exit.

```bash
# The Cardano Submit Service (part of systemd)
# file: /etc/systemd/system/cardano-submit.service

[Unit]
Description     = Cardano submit service
Wants           = network-online.target
After           = network-online.target

[Service]
User            = ada
Type            = simple
WorkingDirectory= /home/ada/pi-pool
ExecStart       = /bin/bash -c "PATH=/home/ada/.local/bin:$PATH exec /home/ada/.local/bin/cardano-submit-service"
KillSignal=SIGINT
RestartKillSignal=SIGINT
TimeoutStopSec=10
LimitNOFILE=32768
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
EnvironmentFile=-/home/ada/.adaenv

[Install]
WantedBy= multi-user.target
```

Reload systemd so it picks up our new service files.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Let's add a couple functions to the bottom of our .adaenv file to make life a little easier.

```bash
nano ${HOME}/.adaenv
```

```bash
cardano-service() {
    #do things with parameters like $1 such as
    sudo systemctl "$1" cardano-node.service
}

cardano-submit() {
    #do things with parameters like $1 such as
    sudo systemctl "$1" cardano-submit.service
}
```

Save & exit.

```bash
source ${HOME}/.adaenv
```

What we just did there was add a couple functions to control our cardano-service and cardano-submit without having to type out

> > sudo systemctl enable cardano-node.service
> >
> > sudo systemctl start cardano-node.service
> >
> > sudo systemctl stop cardano-node.service
> >
> > sudo systemctl status cardano-node.service

Now we just have to:

* cardano-service enable (enables cardano-node.service auto start at boot)
* cardano-service start (starts cardano-node.service)
* cardano-service stop (stops cardano-node.service)
* cardano-service status (shows the status of cardano-node.service)

Or

* cardano-submit enable (enables cardano-submit.service auto start at boot)
* cardano-submit start (starts cardano-submit.service)
* cardano-submit stop (stops cardano-submit.service)
* cardano-submit status (shows the status of cardano-submit.service)

The submit service listens on port 8090. You can connect your Nami wallet like below to submit tx's yourself in Nami's settings.

```bash
http://<node lan ip>:8090/api/submit/tx
```

## ⛓ Syncing the chain ⛓

You are now ready to start cardano-node. Doing so will start the process of 'syncing the chain'. This is going to take about 48 hours and the db folder is about 13GB in size right now. We used to have to sync it to one node and copy it from that node to our new ones to save time. However...

### Download snapshot

I have started taking snapshots of my backup nodes db folder and hosting it in a web directory. With this service it takes around 20 minutes to pull the latest snapshot and maybe another hour to sync up to the tip of the chain. This service is provided as is. It is up to you. If you want to sync the chain on your own simply:

```bash
cardano-service enable
cardano-service start
cardano-service status
```

Otherwise, be sure your node is **not** running & delete the db folder if it exists and download db/.

```bash
cardano-service stop
cd $NODE_HOME
rm -r db/
```

#### Download Database

```bash
wget -r -np -nH -R "index.html*" -e robots=off https://$NODE_CONFIG.adamantium.online/db/
```

Once wget completes enable & start cardano-node.

```bash
cardano-service enable
cardano-service start
cardano-service status
```

## gLiveView.sh

Guild operators scripts has a couple useful tools for operating a pool. We do not want the project as a whole, though there are a couple scripts we are going to use.

{% embed url="https://github.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/tree/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts" %}

```bash
cd $NODE_HOME/scripts
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/env
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/gLiveView.sh
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can change the port cardano-node runs on in the .adaenv file in your home directory. Open the file edit the port number. Load the change into your shell & restart the cardano-node service.

```bash
nano /home/ada/.adaenv
source /home/ada/.adaenv
cardano-service restart
```
{% endhint %}

Add a line sourcing our .adaenv file to the top of the env file and adjust some paths.

```bash
sed -i env \
    -e "/#CNODEBIN/i. ${HOME}/.adaenv" \
    -e "s/\#CNODE_HOME=\"\/opt\/cardano\/cnode\"/CNODE_HOME=\"\${HOME}\/pi-pool\"/g" \
    -e "s/\#CNODE_PORT=6000"/CNODE_PORT=\"'${NODE_PORT}'\""/g" \
    -e "s/\#CONFIG=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/files\/config.json\"/CONFIG=\"\${NODE_FILES}\/"'${NODE_CONFIG}'"-config.json\"/g" \
    -e "s/\#TOPOLOGY=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/files\/topology.json\"/TOPOLOGY=\"\${NODE_FILES}\/"'${NODE_CONFIG}'"-topology.json\"/g" \
    -e "s/\#LOG_DIR=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/logs\"/LOG_DIR=\"\${CNODE_HOME}\/logs\"/g"
```

Allow execution of gLiveView.sh.

```bash
chmod +x gLiveView.sh
```

## topologyUpdater.sh

Until peer to peer is enabled on the network operators need a way to get a list of relays/peers to connect to. The topology updater service runs in the background with cron. Every hour the script will run and tell the service you are a relay and want to be a part of the network. It will add your relay to it's directory after four hours you should see in connections in gLiveView.

{% hint style="info" %}
The list generated will show you the distance & a clue as to where the relay is located.
{% endhint %}

Download the topologyUpdater script and have a look at it. Lower the number of peers to 10 and add any custom peers you wish. These are outgoing connections. You will not see any incoming transactions untill other nodes start connecting to you.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/guild-operators/master/scripts/cnode-helper-scripts/topologyUpdater.sh
```

Lower the number of MX\_PEERS to 10.

```bash
nano topologyUpdater.sh
```

Save, exit and make it executable.

```bash
chmod +x topologyUpdater.sh
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will not be able to successfully execute ./topologyUpdater.sh until you are fully synced up to the tip of the chain.
{% endhint %}

Create a cron job that will run the script every hour.

```bash
crontab -e
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Choose nano when prompted for editor.
{% endhint %}

Add the following to the bottom, save & exit.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Pi-Node image has this cron entry disabled by default. You can enable it by removing the #.
{% endhint %}

```bash
SHELL=/bin/bash
PATH=/home/ada/.local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
33 * * * * . $HOME/.adaenv; $HOME/pi-pool/scripts/topologyUpdater.sh
```

After four hours you can open ${NODE\_CONFIG}-topology.json and inspect the list of out peers the service suggested for you. Remove anything more than 7k distance(or less). IOHK recently suggested 8 out peers. The more out peers the more system resources it uses. You can also add any peers you wish to connect to manualy inside the script. This is where you would add your block producer or any friends nodes.

```bash
nano $NODE_FILES/${NODE_CONFIG}-topology.json
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can use gLiveView.sh to view ping times in relation to the peers in your {NODE\_CONFIG}-topology file. Use Ping to resolve hostnames to IP's.
{% endhint %}

Changes to this file will take affect upon restarting the cardano-service.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't forget to remove the last comma in your topology file!
{% endhint %}

Status should show as enabled & running.

Once your node syncs past epoch 208(shelley era) you can use gLiveView.sh to monitor your sync progress.

{% hint style="danger" %}
It can take over an hour for cardano-node to sync to the tip of the chain. Use ./gliveView.sh, htop and log outputs to view process. Be patient it will come up.
{% endhint %}

```bash
cd $NODE_HOME/scripts
./gLiveView.sh
```

## Prometheus, Node Exporter & Grafana

Prometheus connects to cardano-nodes backend and serves metrics over http. Grafana in turn can use that data to display graphs and create alerts. Our Grafana dashboard will be made up of data from our Ubuntu system & cardano-node. Grafana can display data from other sources as well, like [adapools.org](https://adapools.org).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can connect a [Telegram bot](https://docs.armada-alliance.com/learn/stake-pool-guides/grafana-alerts-with-telegram) to Grafana which can alert you of problems with the server. Much easier than trying to configure email alerts.
{% endhint %}

{% embed url="https://github.com/prometheus" %}

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/pi-pool-grafana (2) (2) (2) (2) (1) (1) (3).png>)

### Install Prometheus & Node Exporter.

{% hint style="info" %}
Prometheus can scrape the http endpoints of other servers running node exporter. Meaning Grafana and Prometheus does not have to be installed on your core and relays. Only the package prometheus-node-exporter is required if you would like to build a central Grafana dashboard for the pool, freeing up resources and having a single dashboard to monitor everything.
{% endhint %}

```bash
sudo apt install prometheus prometheus-node-exporter -y
```

Disable them in systemd for now.

```bash
sudo systemctl disable prometheus.service
sudo systemctl disable prometheus-node-exporter.service
```

### Configure Prometheus

Open prometheus.yml.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Replace the contents of the file with.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Indentation must be correct YAML format or Prometheus will fail to start.
{% endhint %}

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: "codelab-monitor"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label job=<job_name> to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: "Prometheus" # To scrape data from Prometheus Node Exporter
    scrape_interval: 5s
    static_configs:
      #      - targets: ['<CORE PRIVATE IP>:12798']
      #        labels:
      #          alias: 'C1'
      #          type:  'cardano-node'
      #      - targets: ['<RELAY PRIVATE IP>:12798']
      #        labels:
      #          alias: 'R1'
      #          type:  'cardano-node'
      - targets: ["localhost:12798"]
        labels:
          alias: "N1"
          type: "cardano-node"

      #      - targets: ['<CORE PRIVATE IP>:9100']
      #        labels:
      #          alias: 'C1'
      #          type:  'node'
      #      - targets: ['<RELAY PRIVATE IP>:9100']
      #        labels:
      #          alias: 'R1'
      #          type:  'node'
      - targets: ["localhost:9100"]
        labels:
          alias: "N1"
          type: "node"
```

Save & exit.

Start Prometheus.

```bash
sudo systemctl start prometheus.service
```

### Install Grafana

{% embed url="https://github.com/grafana/grafana" %}

Add Grafana's gpg key to Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo su
wget -O- https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/grafana-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Add latest stable repo to apt sources.

```bash
echo "deb [arch=arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/grafana-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
```

Update your package lists & install Grafana.

```bash
sudo apt update; sudo apt install grafana
```

Change the port Grafana listens on so it does not clash with cardano-node.

```bash
sudo sed -i /etc/grafana/grafana.ini \
         -e "s#;http_port#http_port#" \
         -e "s#3000#5000#"
```

Start Grafana

```bash
sudo systemctl start grafana-server.service
```

### cardano-monitor bash function

Open .adaenv.

```bash
cd ${HOME}; nano .adaenv
```

Down at the bottom add.

```bash
cardano-monitor() {
    #do things with parameters like $1 such as
    sudo systemctl "$1" prometheus.service
    sudo systemctl "$1" prometheus-node-exporter.service
    sudo systemctl "$1" grafana-server.service
}
```

Save, exit & source.

```bash
source .adaenv
```

Here we tied all three services under one function. Enable Prometheus.service, prometheus-node-exporter.service & grafana-server.service to run on boot and start the services.

```bash
cardano-monitor enable
cardano-monitor start
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
At this point you may want to start cardano-service and get synced up before we continue to configure Grafana. Go to the syncing the chain section. Choose whether you want to wait 30 hours or download the latest chain snapshot. Return here once gLiveView.sh shows you are at the tip of the chain.
{% endhint %}

## Grafana, Nginx proxy\_pass & snakeoil

Let's put Grafana behind Nginx with self signed(snakeoil) certificate. The certificate was generated when we installed the ssl-cert package.

You will get a warning from your browser. This is because ca-certificates cannot follow a trust chain to a trusted (centralized) source. The connection is however encrypted and will protect your passwords flying around in plain text.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Replace contents of the file with below.

```bash
# Default server configuration
#
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
        # SSL configuration
        #
        listen 443 ssl default_server;
        #listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
        #
        # Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
        #
        # Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
        #
        # Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
        # Don't use them in a production server!
        #
        include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

        add_header X-Proxy-Cache $upstream_cache_status;
        location / {
          proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
          proxy_redirect      off;
          include proxy_params;
        }
}
```

Check that Nginx is happy with our changes and restart it.

```bash
sudo nginx -t
## if ok, do
sudo service nginx restart
```

You can now visit your pi-nodes ip address without any port specification, the connection will be upgraded to SSL/TLS and you will get a scary message(not really scary at all). Continue through to your dashboard.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/snakeoil.png)

### Configure Grafana

On your local machine open your browser and enter your nodes private ip address.

Log in and set a new password. Default username and password is **admin:admin**.

#### Configure data source

In the left hand vertical menu go to **Configure** > **Datasources** and click to **Add data source**. Choose Prometheus. Enter [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) where it is grayed out, everything else can be left default. At the bottom save & test. You should get the green "Data source is working" if cardano-monitor has been started. If for some reason those services failed to start issue **cardano-service restart**.

#### Import dashboards

Save the dashboard json files to your local machine.

{% embed url="https://github.com/armada-alliance/dashboards" %}

In the left hand vertical menu go to **Dashboards** > **Manage** and click on **Import**. Select the file you just downloaded/created and save. Head back to **Dashboards** > **Manage** and click on your new dashboard.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/pi-pool-grafana (2) (2) (2) (2) (1) (1) (4).png>)

### Configure poolDataLive

Here you can use the poolData api to bring extra pool data into Grafana like stake & price.

{% embed url="https://api.pooldata.live/dashboard" %}

Follow the instructions to install the Grafana plugin, configure your datasource and import the dashboard.
